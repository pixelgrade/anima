## Contributing code
An overview of the process for contributors is:
1. Fork the Anima repository.
2. Clone the forked repository locally.
3. Create a new branch.

5. Commit your changes when youâ€™re happy with them.
6. Push the branch to the forked repository.

### Prerequisites
We require certain **Node.js (v14)** and **PHP (v7.4**) versions and the easiest way to install and manage node is to use the [Node Version Manager ](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm).

For the `zsh` shell you can use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) with the `nvm` [plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/nvm) activated.

We use the following list of `oh-my-zsh` plugins: `plugins=(composer git nvm npm)` configured in `~/.zshrc`. 

For automatic node version switching, place the following line in `~/.zshrc` file, just below the plugins line: `NVM_AUTOLOAD=1`. 

Now whenever you enter a directory through the shell, if it finds a `.nvmrc` file, it will switch to the specified node version.

### Getting the Anima theme code
Fork the Anima repository and then clone it to your computer using the terminal:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/anima
$ cd anima
```

### Building Anima theme
The Anima theme build system uses NodeJS. To set up it up, you first need to make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine. Then run the following command in the project root folder to install dependencies:

```
